# Creating a Diversified Stock Portfolio Using Clustering Analysis

### About

The aim of the project is to create a diversified portfolio of stocks using clustering analysis and back test its performance against the historical data of a stock index. For this we look at the S&P500 index, that is deemed to be the most accurate quantifier of the US economy. S&P500 is the comparable standard for many funds in the marketplace.
